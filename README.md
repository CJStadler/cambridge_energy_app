#How To Use This Template

##Step 1
[![mirror this repo](http://mirror.therebelrobot.com/badge-large.svg)](http://mirror.therebelrobot.com/?source=codeforboston/project-template)

Clone the `project-template` repo using [mirror](http://mirror.therebelrobot.com/?source=codeforboston/project-template). Sign in, and put the new repository name in the "Target Repo" section. After you've mirrored the repo, navigate to it in your account, and update the Description and Link at the top of the repo page.

##Step 2
There is a file which is entitled `readme-template.md`.  This contains the template for the readme to your new project.  Follow the section headings and replace content as needed. 

Note: you will need to rename the `readme-tempate.md` file to `README.md` and delete this file for it to show up on the repository home page. 

##Step 3
In the folder labeled `wiki`, there are individual page templates that need to be added to your project wiki in order to flesh out the project documentation.  

Open each page individually in your editor and search for a string of four underscores (eg ____).  Hit select all, and replace with the name of your new project.  

##Step 4
Create a corresponding new page in the wiki for each text file in the `wiki` folder.  Copy the text from each of the `.md` files to the new corresponding wiki pages. 

##Step 5
Carefully read through each page and customize the information according to the needs and character of your project.  

####Important!  This is not a one-time step.  It needs to be updated on a weekly basis.

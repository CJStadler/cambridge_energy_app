#How To Use This Template

##Step 1
Fork the `project-template` repo. Navigate to the repo in your own account and click "settings" on the sidebar on the right.  In the field that contains the repository name, replace `project-template` with the name of your new project.

##Step 2
There is a file which is entitled `readme-template.md`.  This contains the template for the readme to your new project.  Follow the section headings and replace content as needed. 

Note: you will need to rename the `readme-tempate.md` file to `README.md` and delete this file for it to show up on the repository home page. 

##Step 3
In the folder labeled `wiki`, there are individual page templates that need to be added to your project wiki in order to flesh out the project documentation.  

Open each page individually in your editor and search for a string of four underscores (eg ____).  Hit select all, and replace with the name of your new project.  

##Step 4
Carefully read through each page and customize the information according to the needs and character of your project.  

####Important!  This is not a one-time step.  It needs to be updated on a weekly basis.

##Step 5
Create a corresponding new page in the wiki for each text file in the `wiki` folder.  Copy the text from each of the `.md` files to the new corresponding wiki pages.
